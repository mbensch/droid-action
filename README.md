# Droid Actions for GitHub

This GitHub Action powers the Factory **Droid** app. It watches your pull requests for supported commands and runs a full Droid Exec session to help you ship faster:

- `@droid fill` — turns a bare pull request into a polished description that matches your template or our opinionated fallback.
- `@droid review` — performs an automated code review, surfaces potential bugs, and leaves inline comments directly on the diff.
- `@droid security` — performs an automated security review using STRIDE methodology, identifying vulnerabilities and suggesting fixes.
- `@droid security --full` — performs a full repository security scan and creates a PR with the report.

Everything runs inside GitHub Actions using your Factory API key, so the bot never leaves your repository and operates with the permissions you grant.

## CI Steward

CI Steward runs after configured workflows complete. It waits for all checks on
the commit, summarizes failed job logs, retries flaky or infrastructure
failures, and either commits a focused fix or posts inline suggestions.

Copy `templates/droid-ci-steward.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci-steward.yml` and
replace the workflow names with the checks you want to monitor. Enable direct
fixes with `auto_fix: "true"` only when the workflow has `contents: write`.

Leave `github_token` unset so the action authenticates as the Factory Droid
GitHub App, and keep `id-token: write` in the permissions block. This matters
more here than elsewhere: GitHub does not start a new workflow run for a push
made with `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, so an auto-fix commit would land under stale
failing checks and never be verified. Reading job logs and rerunning jobs
always use the workflow token, which is why `actions: write` is also required.

The optional `.github/droid-ci.yml` file can configure `retry`, `fix`,
`workflows.exclude`, `skip`, `instructions`, and the lifetime
`max_runs_per_pr` budget. It is always read from the repository's **default
branch**, never from the pull request, so a branch cannot grant itself
auto-fix or clear its own protected paths. The budgets have distinct scopes:

- `max_retries` limits reruns of one failed job for one commit.
- `max_fix_attempts` limits consecutive fix commits from CI Steward.
- `max_runs_per_pr` limits all CI Steward invocations over the PR lifetime.

### Trust boundary

**CI Steward does not run on pull requests from forks.** `workflow_run` executes
in the base repository with write-scoped tokens and access to secrets, so
checking out a fork's commit and running commands against it would hand the
pull request author the app token, the workflow token, and your Factory API
key. The template enforces this with a job-level condition, and the action
re-checks it in case CI Steward is wired into a hand-written workflow.

Two further limits follow from the same reasoning:

- The shell and file-writing tools are granted only when `fix.enabled` is on.
  A diagnosis-only run cannot modify the working tree.
- `fix.protected_paths` is enforced after the run, not merely requested in the
  prompt. Changes to a protected path are reverted and the job fails.
- `fix.scope` decides which failures may be fixed, and is enforced by
  withholding the editing tools rather than by asking. The failing jobs for the
  commit are classified before Droid starts, and if none of them fall inside
  the scope the run is diagnosis-only. A commit whose only failure is
  `deploy-staging` therefore cannot be modified under the default scope, even
  with `auto_fix` on. Job names are matched by category, so `unit`, `tsc` and
  `eslint` are recognized as `tests`, `types` and `lint`; an unrecognized name
  stays out of scope, and the reason is printed in the job log.

## What Happens When You Tag `@droid`

1. **Trigger detection** – The action scans issue comments, PR descriptions, and review comments for `@droid` commands.
2. **Context gathering** – Droid collects the PR metadata, existing comments, changed files, and any PR description template in your repository.
3. **Prompt generation** – We compose a precise prompt instructing Droid what to do and which GitHub MCP tools it may use.
4. **Execution** – The action runs `droid exec` with full repository context. MCP tools are pre-registered so Droid can call the GitHub APIs safely.
5. **Results** – For fill, Droid updates the PR body. For review/security, it posts inline feedback and a summary comment.

## Installation

### Quick Setup with `/install-code-review` (Recommended)

The fastest way to get up and running is the guided installer built into the Droid CLI. From any local clone of your repo, run:

```bash
droid
> /install-code-review
```

The guided flow will:

- Detect whether your repository lives on GitHub or GitLab.
- Help you install the Droid GitHub App (or configure GitLab access).
- Generate the workflow files (`droid.yml` and `droid-review.yml`) with sensible defaults.
- Prompt you for `review_depth`, security review options, and other inputs.
- Open a PR/MR containing the new workflow files for you to review and merge.

For GitHub-only setups you can also run `/install-github-app`. See the [Automated Code Review guide](https://docs.factory.ai/guides/droid-exec/code-review) and the [GitHub App installation guide](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/features/install-github-app) for full details.

### GitLab

GitLab support ships as a **GitLab CI/CD Component** that delivers automated code review — inline MR comments on every merge request, with optional security review.

Two files in your project:

`factory/droid-review.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - project: "factory-components/droid-action"
    ref: main
    file: "/templates/droid-review.yml"
    inputs:
      automatic_review: "true"
      automatic_security_review: "false"
      review_depth: "deep"

droid-review:
  variables:
    FACTORY_API_KEY: $FACTORY_API_KEY
    GITLAB_TOKEN: $GITLAB_TOKEN
```

`.gitlab-ci.yml` (one include line, append to existing if present):

```yaml
include:
  - local: "factory/droid-review.yml"
```

Full setup, available inputs, and troubleshooting live in [`docs/gitlab-setup.md`](docs/gitlab-setup.md).

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to wire things up by hand:

1. **Install the Droid GitHub App**
   - Install from the Factory dashboard and grant it access to the repositories where you want Droid to operate.
2. **Create a Factory API Key**
   - Generate a token at [https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys) and save it as `FACTORY_API_KEY` in your repository or organization secrets.
3. **Add the Action Workflows**
   - Create two workflow files under `.github/workflows/` to separate on-demand tagging from automatic PR reviews, based on your needs.

### Setup

`droid.yml` (responds to explicit `@droid` mentions):

```yaml
name: Droid Tag

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  droid:
    if: |
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@droid')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@droid')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review' && contains(github.event.review.body, '@droid')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'issues' && (contains(github.event.issue.body, '@droid') || contains(github.event.issue.title, '@droid'))) ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && (contains(github.event.pull_request.body, '@droid') || contains(github.event.pull_request.title, '@droid')))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Run Droid Exec
        uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
        with:
          factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
```

Once committed, tagging `@droid fill`, `@droid review`, or `@droid security` on an open PR will trigger the bot automatically.

`droid-review.yml` (automatic reviews on PRs):

```yaml
name: Droid Auto Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, ready_for_review, reopened]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  droid-review:
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - name: Run Droid Auto Review
        uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
        with:
          factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
          automatic_review: true
          automatic_security_review: true
```

Set `automatic_review: true` to run code reviews automatically on non-draft PRs. Set `automatic_security_review: true` to additionally run a STRIDE-based security review concurrently on every non-draft PR.

Automatic code-review passes can also follow up on existing inline review
threads. Both behaviors are disabled by default:

```yaml
with:
  automatic_review: true
  resolve_fixed_review_threads: true
  review_other_bot_comments: true
```

`resolve_fixed_review_threads` resolves an unresolved Droid thread only when
the validator finds concrete evidence that the reported problem is fixed.
`review_other_bot_comments` evaluates unresolved comments from configured
Claude and Cursor bot accounts, then replies once with `Droid agrees.` or
`Droid disagrees: <Explanation>`. It does not resolve another bot's thread.

The defaults recognize `factory-droid[bot]`, `claude[bot]`,
`claude-code[bot]`, `cursor[bot]`, and `cursorreview[bot]`. GitHub GraphQL
may return these Bot actors without the `[bot]` suffix; the action normalizes
that exact suffix while still requiring the actor type to be `Bot`. Override
`droid_review_bot_logins` or `other_review_bot_logins` with comma-separated
GitHub logins when your apps use different accounts. Keep the workflow's
per-PR `concurrency` group, as shown above, to prevent overlapping review
passes. These features require `pull-requests: write`.

## Using the Commands

### `@droid fill`

- Place the command in the PR description or in a top-level comment.
- Droid searches for common PR template locations (`.github/pull_request_template.md`, etc.). When a template exists, it fills the sections; otherwise it writes a structured summary (overview, changes, testing, rollout).
- The original request is replaced with the generated description so reviewers can merge immediately.

### `@droid review`

- Mention `@droid review` in a PR comment.
- Droid inspects the diff, prioritizes potential bugs or high-impact issues, and leaves inline comments directly on the changed lines.
- A short summary comment is posted in the original thread highlighting the findings and linking to any inline feedback.

### `@droid security`

- Mention `@droid security` in a PR comment to trigger an on-demand security review of the PR diff.
- Droid runs a security-focused review using STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) along with OWASP Top 10 and OWASP LLM Top 10 checks.
- Each finding includes a severity level, CWE reference (where applicable), an explanation, and a suggested fix posted as inline review comments.
- Set `automatic_security_review: true` in your auto-review workflow to run the security pass on every non-draft PR alongside the standard code review (the two run concurrently).

### `@droid security --full`

- Performs a full repository security scan instead of just PR changes — useful for scheduled audits or onboarding a new repo.
- Creates a new branch and opens a PR containing a security report at `.factory/security/reports/security-report-{date}.md` plus auto-generated patches where Droid is confident in the fix.
- To run on a schedule, invoke the action from a cron-triggered workflow with `security_scan_schedule: true`. Use `security_scan_days` to control how many days of recent commits are included.

#### Enabling automatic security review

To run the security review on every non-draft PR (alongside the regular code review), add `automatic_security_review: true` to your `droid-review.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run Droid Auto Review
  uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
  with:
    factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
    automatic_review: true
    automatic_security_review: true
```

#### Scheduling full-repo scans

```yaml
name: Droid Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 09:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
        with:
          factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
          security_scan_schedule: true
          security_scan_days: 7
```

## Authentication

Droid needs two separate kinds of access: permission to run Droid, and permission to post on your pull requests. You set them up independently.

### 1. Factory API key (run Droid)

Droid runs using your Factory API key. Create one at [app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.factory.ai/settings/api-keys) and save it as a `FACTORY_API_KEY` secret in your repository or organization. Pass it to the action on every run:

```yaml
- uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
  with:
    factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
```

This input is required.

### 2. GitHub access (post reviews)

To leave comments and approvals on your PRs, Droid needs a GitHub token. There are two ways to provide one:

- **Factory Droid GitHub App (default, recommended).** If you don't pass a token, the action securely requests one for the installed Factory Droid GitHub App. For most teams this is all you need: install the app on your repositories from [app.factory.ai/settings/organization](https://app.factory.ai/settings/organization). It requires the `id-token: write` permission so the action can request the token:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write
    id-token: write # required for GitHub App auth
  ```

- **Your own token (override).** If you'd rather use a personal access token or your own GitHub App — for example on GitHub Enterprise, or to control which account posts comments — pass it as `github_token`. When set, Droid uses it directly and skips the app. The token needs write access to pull requests and repository contents.

  ```yaml
  - uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
    with:
      factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
      github_token: ${{ secrets.MY_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  ```

> On GitLab, the same two pieces apply: set `FACTORY_API_KEY` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` as CI/CD variables. See [`docs/gitlab-setup.md`](docs/gitlab-setup.md).

## Configuration

### Core Inputs

| Input             | Purpose                                                                                                |

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `automatic_review`             | `false`                | Automatically run code review on PRs without requiring `@droid review`.                              |
| `resolve_fixed_review_threads` | `false`                | Resolve earlier Droid inline findings that current code conclusively fixes.                          |
| `review_other_bot_comments`    | `false`                | Reply once with Droid's disposition on configured AI-bot inline comments.                            |
| `droid_review_bot_logins`      | `factory-droid[bot]`   | Trusted Droid author logins eligible for thread resolution.                                          |
| `other_review_bot_logins`      | Claude/Cursor defaults | Trusted AI-bot author logins eligible for disposition replies.                                       |
| `review_depth`                 | `deep`                 | Review depth preset: `shallow` (fast) or `deep` (thorough). See [Review Depth](#review-depth) below. |
| `review_model`                 | `""`                   | Override the model for code review. When empty, determined by `review_depth`.                        |
| `reasoning_effort`             | `""`                   | Override reasoning effort for review. When empty, determined by `review_depth`.                      |
| `review_candidates_max_turns`  | `100`                  | Stop candidate generation after this many assistant turns.                                           |
| `review_validator_max_turns`   | `40`                   | Stop validation after this many assistant turns.                                                     |
| `fill_model`                   | `""`                   | Override the model used for PR description fill.                                                     |

### Review Depth

The `review_depth` input controls which model and reasoning effort are used for code reviews. Two presets are available:

| Depth       | Model         | Reasoning Effort | Best For                                                |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **deep**    | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `high`           | Thorough reviews catching subtle bugs and design issues |
| **shallow** | `glm-5.2`     | default          | Fast, cost-effective reviews for straightforward PRs    |

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Deep review (default - no extra config needed)
- uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
  with:
    factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
    automatic_review: true

# Shallow review for faster feedback
- uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
  with:
    factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
    automatic_review: true
    review_depth: shallow

# Fully custom model (overrides depth preset entirely)
- uses: Factory-AI/droid-action@main
  with:
    factory_api_key: ${{ secrets.FACTORY_API_KEY }}
    automatic_review: true
    review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    reasoning_effort: high
```

> **Tip:** Setting `review_model` or `reasoning_effort` explicitly always takes priority over the depth preset. You can mix and match -- for example, use `review_depth: shallow` but override just `reasoning_effort: high` to get the shallow model with higher reasoning.

The default models (`gpt-5.6-sol` for `deep`, `glm-5.2` for `shallow`) are managed by Factory and may change over time. To pin a specific model regardless of the depth preset, set `review_model` to any model ID supported by `droid exec --model`. A few common choices:

- `claude-opus-4-7`
- `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `claude-haiku-4-5`
- `gpt-5.6-sol`
- `gpt-5.5`
- `gpt-5.5-pro`
- `gpt-5.3-codex`
- `glm-5.2`
- `kimi-k2.6`

See the [CLI reference](https://docs.factory.ai/reference/cli-reference#available-models) for the canonical, up-to-date list.

### Security Configuration

| Input                         | Default  | Purpose                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `security_model`              | `""`     | Override the model used for security review. Falls back to `review_model` if not set.                             |
| `security_severity_threshold` | `medium` | Minimum severity to report (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`). Findings below this threshold are filtered out. |
| `security_block_on_critical`  | `true`   | Submit `REQUEST_CHANGES` review when critical severity findings are detected.                                     |
| `security_block_on_high`      | `false`  | Submit `REQUEST_CHANGES` review when high severity findings are detected.                                         |
| `security_notify_team`        | `""`     | GitHub team to @mention on critical findings (e.g., `@org/security-team`).                                        |
| `security_scan_schedule`      | `false`  | Configuration for scheduled security scans (when invoked from scheduled workflows).                               |
| `security_scan_days`          | `7`      | Number of days of commits to scan for scheduled security scans.                                                   |

## Custom Review Guidelines

You can add repository-specific review guidelines by creating a `.factory/skills/review-guidelines/SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
Additional checks for this codebase:

- React hooks rules violations
- Missing TypeScript types on public APIs
- Prisma query performance issues
```

These guidelines are automatically loaded and injected into all review prompts (code review, security review, and validation passes). No workflow changes needed.

## Security Skills

The security review uses specialized Factory skills installed from the public `Factory-AI/skills` repository:

- **threat-model-generation** – Generates STRIDE-based threat models for repositories
- **commit-security-scan** – Scans code changes for security vulnerabilities
- **vulnerability-validation** – Validates findings and filters false positives
- **security-review** – Comprehensive security review and patch generation

These skills are automatically installed when running security reviews.

## Troubleshooting & Support

- Check the workflow run linked from the Droid tracking comment for execution logs.
- Verify that the workflow file and repository allow the GitHub App to run (branch protections can block bots).
- Automatic security reviews are deduplicated per PR to reduce duplicate scans; use `@droid security` explicitly if you need to re-run.
- Need more detail? Start with the [Setup Guide](./docs/setup.md) or [FAQ](./docs/faq.md).
