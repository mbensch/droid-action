/**
 * Platform-agnostic Pass 2 (validator) prompt.
 *
 * The validator reads the candidates JSON produced by Pass 1, validates
 * each one, and writes a refined JSON to disk. What happens next depends
 * on `postingMode`:
 *
 *   - "tool": the agent posts approved findings through an MCP tool.
 *   - "file" (GitHub and GitLab): the validated JSON is the deliverable,
 *     and a deterministic CI step posts it through the platform API. The
 *     agent holds no PR/MR mutation tools.
 *
 * Both `src/create-prompt/templates/review-validator-prompt.ts` (GitHub)
 * and `src/gitlab/prompts/validator.ts` (GitLab) delegate to this builder
 * via thin adapters that supply a `ReviewTerminology` shape.

  \`${validatedPath}\`.
* Anything you leave out of \`${validatedPath}\`, or mark as anything other than
  \`"approved"\`, will never reach the ${t.entityNoun}. That file is the whole contract.
* An approved comment without a usable line anchor cannot be posted, so make sure
  every approved comment keeps its \`path\`, \`side\`, and \`line\` (\`side: "RIGHT"\`
  anchors to the new file line, \`side: "LEFT"\` anchors to the old file line).
* A line anchor that is not part of the diff (neither added, removed, nor context
  inside a hunk) cannot be posted inline and degrades to a non-inline finding —
  prefer re-anchoring such findings to the nearest related changed line.

  return `You are validating candidate review comments for ${t.entityNoun} ${t.entityNumberSigil}${entityNumber} in ${repoOrProject}.

IMPORTANT: This is Phase 2 (validator) of a two-pass review pipeline.

${skillInstruction}

### Context

* ${t.repoLabel}: ${repoOrProject}
* ${t.entityNumberLabel}: ${entityNumber}
* ${t.headRefLabel}: ${headRef}
* ${t.headShaLabel}: ${headSha}
* ${t.baseRefLabel}: ${baseRef}

### Inputs

Read these files before validating:
* ${t.descriptionLabel}: \`${descriptionPath}\`
* Candidates: \`${candidatesPath}\`
* ${t.diffLabel}: \`${diffPath}\`
* Existing Comments: \`${commentsPath}\`

If the diff is large, read in chunks (offset/limit). **Do not proceed until you have read the ENTIRE diff.**

### Critical Requirements

1. You MUST read and validate **every** candidate before ${postingMode === "file" ? `writing \`${validatedPath}\`` : "posting anything"}.
2. Preserve ordering: keep results in the same order as candidates.
3. ${
    postingMode === "file"
      ? `**Approval rule (STRICT):** mark a candidate \`"approved"\` only if you would stand behind posting it as-is — approved entries are posted verbatim. Everything else must be \`"rejected"\`.`
      : `**Posting rule (STRICT):** Only post comments where \`status === "approved"\`. Never post rejected items.`

Notes:
* Use \`commit_id\` = \`${headSha}\`.
* \`results\` MUST have exactly one entry per candidate, in the same order.

Tooling note:
* If the tools list includes \`ApplyPatch\` (common for OpenAI models like GPT-5.2), use \`ApplyPatch\` to create/update the file at the exact path.
* Otherwise, use \`Create\` (or \`Edit\` if overwriting) to write the file.
